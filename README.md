# Learning Python With Unity

This Unity project makes use of the Unity package *Python for Unity* to teach some basic fundamentals of Python, and programming in general, through visualisation and gameplay


## Installation

1. Download the project code from GitHub and extract the Unity Project folder to an appropriate location

2. Make sure you have a working version of Python, preferably **3.10** as that was the version used when creating this project but it should work with slightly older or newer versions as well

3. Open the project folder using Unity Hub, ensuring that you are using Unity version **2021.1.21f1**

4. After the project has finished building, open the Main Menu scene and press play; you should be greeted by this:

When working the respective Python files for each level, it is recommended to open the Python folder found within Assets with an external IDE like PyCharm as the interface provided with Python for Unity can be unforgiving and offers no syntax checking 

## Usage

There are six different levels users can test out and work on as part of this project, each testing a different element of python programming:

### Level 1
![Lesson01_Task1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188088564-7ff71df0-5284-4c58-a22a-70507ff8cd3f.jpg)

This lesson tests for loops, nested for loops and some conditional statements

### Level 2
![Lesson02_Task2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188088881-0106c37a-81e5-449b-a978-b6a35ea85eb2.jpg)

This lesson tests list manipulation and slicing

### Level 3
![lesson03_GameView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188090823-d3125ff0-4155-4579-9ce4-e8688c4b8263.jpg)

This lesson tests if else statements

### Level 4
![lesson04_GameView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188092528-4c228f96-01d7-49bc-8e52-158d42bdb163.jpg)

This lesson builds on if statement logic learned previously

### Level 5
![lesson05_GameView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188093296-0295825e-4353-46cb-a5f6-22bea0b8813c.jpg)

This lesson tests while loop knowledge

### Level 6
![lesson06_GameView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43437825/188094162-1ccf5ccc-67e4-4e96-b30a-aa6cc560f441.jpg)

Lesson 6 builds on the previous levels with a series of rooms which test different skills, some more complex than others

- for loops
- if statements
- list slicing
- dictionary inversion
- sorting lists based on other lists
- combining lists into a dictionary
